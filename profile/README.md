## PKU-DaGame

Distributed and Automated Games and Managerial Economics (DaGAME) Lab was founded by Professor Xiaotie Deng in 2019 at Peking University. The research subjects of lab are algorithmic game theory, Internet and blockchain economics, theory of multi-agents and deep reinforcement learning. We focus on the methodological studies for the interactions of human with agents, in the epistemological changes with respect to acquisition of data and information, equilibrium and game dynamics among human and agents, computational and communication complexity, design and analysis of algorithms and protocols. We are especially interested in the applications of Internet market design, analysis of incentives and cooperative competition, as well as high performance consensus, reputation system design and cross-chain mechanism design in Blockchain economics and technology.
